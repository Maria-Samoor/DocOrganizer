# DocOrganizer

## Project Overview

**DocOrganizer** is a secure document management system designed to help users manage, organize, and secure their digital documents. The project focuses on software security, ensuring that all user data is protected through various security measures.

## Project Idea

The primary goal of DocOrganizer is to provide a reliable and secure platform for users to store and manage their documents. The system includes features such as user authentication, document encryption, role-based access control, and secure document sharing. By leveraging robust security practices, DocOrganizer aims to safeguard user data against unauthorized access and potential security threats.

## Used Technologies

### Backend
- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django is known for its strong security features, which include protections against common security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and clickjacking.

### Frontend
- **Bulma:** A modern CSS framework based on Flexbox. Bulma is simple to use and provides a clean, responsive design that enhances the user experience. It is well-suited for creating elegant and mobile-friendly user interfaces.

## Features

1. **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system to ensure that only authorized users can access their documents.
2. **Document Encryption:** All user documents are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Role-Based Access Control:** Different levels of access are granted based on user roles to ensure appropriate permissions are maintained.
4. **Secure Document Sharing:** Users can securely share documents with other authorized users.
5. **Activity Logging:** Detailed logs of user activities to monitor and audit system usage.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or higher
